# cmake-tutorials
A repository containing practical CMake tutorials to understand the underlying purposes and functions.

## Purpose
CMake is a tool for creating cross-compilation projects. It is a programming way to build projects.
CMake is considered difficult to comprehend, and the documentation doesn't always make it easier.
This repository contains tutorials and documentation about the use cases of CMake and the commands.

## Motivation
Every time I use CMake, i step into recursive and repetitive problems. Therefore, I decided to create a tutorial repository for
myself and everyone who has troubles with understanding and using CMake.

I hope this tutorial will help you understand all the functionalities. For me this was a great opportunity to learn CMake and I don't want to enjoy it alone.
